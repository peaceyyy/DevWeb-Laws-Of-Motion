            He was born on December 25, 1642 and Died on March 20 , 1727 Sir
            Isaac Newton worked in many areas of mathematics and physics. He
            developed the theories of gravitation in 1666 when he was only 23
            years old. In 1686, he presented his three laws of motion in the
            “Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis.”

          <p>
            Isaac Newton, as any scientist is supposed to be, was a very curious
            man. He would not take things around him for a given and started wondering
            and investigating what makes objects move. That is how he thought up his
            three laws that describe the relationship between an object’s motion and the
            forces that make it move or stop. These three laws laid the foundation for
            Newtonian mechanics — a physical theory that describes the moving of visible
            objects of different sizes: from tiny ones to super huge as spacecraft, planets,
            and galaxies.

   <h1>Inertia</h1>
   <h2>Newton's First Law</h2>
   <div class="law-information">
     <div class="law-desc">
       An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force.
       
       Newton's first law states that every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change its state by the action of an external force. This tendency to resist changes in a state of motion is <i><strong>inertia</strong></i>. If all the external forces cancel each other out, then there is no net force acting on the object. If there is no net force acting on the object, then the object will maintain a constant velocity.
       
       <p class="law-statement">This is what the law of inertia states:</p>
       
       <p class="law-highlight"><b>Unless you push or pull (apply a force on) an object, it will remain at rest or in uniform.</b></p>
       
       <p>Any type of force can be applied to it, and it does not necessarily have to come from a human.</p>

       <h4>2. Hockey Puck Sliding on Ice</h4>
       <p>A hockey puck will keep sliding on a smooth ice surface at a constant speed until forces like friction or a player's stick act on it to slow it down.</p>
       <p class="explanation"><b>Explanation:</b> The puck continues its motion due to inertia, but external forces (friction, stick) change its motion.</p>

     <div class="example">
       <h4>3. Seatbelt in a Car</h4>
       <p>When a car suddenly stops, your body continues moving forward. The seatbelt applies a force to stop you, preventing you from continuing at the car's speed.</p>

        <h2>Newton's Second Law</h2>
        <div class="law-information">
          <div class="law-desc">
            Newton's second law of motion pertains to the behavior of objects for which all existing forces are not balanced. The second law states that the acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables - the net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object. The acceleration of an object depends directly upon the net force acting upon the object, and inversely upon the mass of the object. As the force acting upon an object is increased, the acceleration of the object is increased. As the mass of an object is increased, the acceleration of the object is decreased.
          </div>
          <p class="law-statement">The second law states:</p>
      <p class="law-highlight">The acceleration of an object is connected to the force which is acting on it. The object speeds up due to the force acting on it.</p>
