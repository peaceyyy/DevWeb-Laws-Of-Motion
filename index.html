            He is well known for his discoveries in optics (white light
            composition) and mathematics (calculus), it is his formulation of
            the three laws of motion, the basic principles of modern physics,
            for which he is most famous.

            He was born on December 25, 1642 and Died on March 20 , 1727 Sir
            Isaac Newton worked in many areas of mathematics and physics. He
            developed the theories of gravitation in 1666 when he was only 23
            years old. In 1686, he presented his three laws of motion in the
            “Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis.”

          <h1>Why</h1>
          <p>
            Isaac Newton, as any scientist is supposed to be, was a very curious
            man. He would not take things around him for a given and started wondering
            and investigating what makes objects move. That is how he thought up his
            three laws that describe the relationship between an object’s motion and the
            forces that make it move or stop. These three laws laid the foundation for
            Newtonian mechanics — a physical theory that describes the moving of visible
            objects of different sizes: from tiny ones to super huge as spacecraft, planets,
            and galaxies.

            Isaac Newton was a English physicist and mathematician who was the

        <h2>What are the three laws of motion?</h2>
        An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in
        motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an
        unbalanced force. The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the
        object and the amount of force applied. Whenever one object exerts a force
        on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite on the
        first.

        <h2>Familiarize yourself with the following terms as they usually come up as the main Variables in Newton's Laws
          of Motion!</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Force (F): an external agent capable of changing a body’s state of
            rest or motion. It has a magnitude and a direction. The direction
            towards which the force is applied is known as the direction of the
            force, and the application of force is the point where force is
            applied.

          <h1>Inertia</h1>
          <h2>Newton's First Law</h2>
          <div class="inertia-information">
            <div class="law-desc"> An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at
              constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force.
              Newton’s first law states that every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line
              unless compelled to change its state by the action of an external force. This tendency to resist changes
              in a state of motion is <i><strong>inertia</strong></i>. If all the external forces cancel each other out, then there is no net force
              acting on the object. If there is no net force acting on the object, then the object will maintain a
              constant velocity.
              <br> <br>
              This is what the law of inertia states:
              <br> <br>
              <b>Unless you push or pull (apply a force on) an object, it will remain at rest or in uniform.</b>
              <br> <br>
              Any type of force can be applied to it, and it does not necessarily have to come from a human.

            Examples:
            Book on a Table (An object at rest remains at rest):
            A book sitting still on a table will remain at rest unless someone pushes it or another force acts on it
            (like
            gravity pulling it down).
            Explanation: The book's inertia keeps it stationary until a force acts on it.

            Hockey Puck Sliding on Ice (an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line):
            A hockey puck will keep sliding on a smooth ice surface at a constant speed until forces like friction or a
            player's stick act on it to slow it down.
            Explanation: The puck continues its motion due to inertia, but external forces (friction, stick) change its
            motion.

            Seatbelt in a Car (unless acted on by an unbalanced force):
            When a car suddenly stops, your body continues moving forward. The seatbelt applies a force to stop you,
            preventing you from continuing at the car’s speed.
            Explanation: Your body has inertia and wants to keep moving, but the external force (seatbelt) stops you.


            Examples of inertia involving aerodynamics:
            The motion of an airplane when a pilot changes the throttle setting of an engine.
            The motion of a ball falling down through the atmosphere.
            A model rocket being launched up into the atmosphere.
            The motion of a kite when the wind changes.

          <h1>Acceleration</h1>
          <h2>Newton's second Law</h2>
          <div class="law-information">
            <div class="law-desc">
              Newton's second law of motion pertains to the behavior of objects for which all existing forces are not
              balanced. The second law states that the acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables - the
              net
              force acting upon the object and the mass of the object. The acceleration of an object depends directly
              upon
              the net force acting upon the object, and inversely upon the mass of the object. As the force acting upon
              an
              object is increased, the acceleration of the object is increased. As the mass of an object is increased,
              the
              acceleration of the object is decreased.
            </div>

            <img src="assets/motion2.jpg">
            <br>
            <img src="assets/motion2-figure1.gif">
            The second law states:

            The acceleration of an object is connected to the force which is acting on it. The object speeds up due to
            the
            force acting on it.
          </div>
          <div class="formulas">
            This is why this law has a formula:

            a = F / m,

            in which:

            a — is the acceleration that is measured in meters per second squared (m/s2). It means that if an object
            accelerates at 1 m/s2, its speed is increasing by 1 meter per second every second.
            F — is a force that is measured in newtons (yes, he was so cool they named this unit of measurement in his
            honor)
            m — is an object’s mass that is measured in kilos.

            Examples:
            Pushing a Stroller
            A light stroller moves faster with a little push, but a heavier stroller needs more force to move at the
            same
            speed.
            Explanation: The stroller’s acceleration depends on its mass and the force applied.
            2. Throwing a Ball
            Throwing a small tennis ball is easier and faster than throwing a heavy basketball with the same effort.
            Explanation: The lighter tennis ball requires less force to accelerate, while the heavier basketball resists
            motion more due to its greater mass.
            3. Kicking a Ball
            A stronger kick makes the ball go farther because more force means more acceleration.
            Explanation: Greater force increases the ball’s acceleration, demonstrating the direct relationship between
            force and motion.

        <div id="action-reaction">
          <h1>Action and Reaction</h1>
          <h2>Newton's Third Law</h2>
          <div class="law-information">
            <div class="law-desc">His third law states that for every action (force) in nature there is an equal and
              opposite reaction. If object A exerts a force on object B, object B also exerts an equal and opposite
              force
              on object A. In other words, forces result from interactions</div>

            <img src="assets/motion-3.png">

            <br>

            This law signifies a particular symmetry in nature: forces always occur in pairs, and one body cannot exert
            a
            force on another without experiencing a force itself. In the next few sections, let us learn Newton’s third
            law in detail.
            That is why this law is called the <b>the law of action and reaction</b>
